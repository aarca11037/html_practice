                My name is Anthony A. I am a recent graduate who's currently honing his skills in the hopes of getting a job.
                I graduated in 2024 as a Computer Science major.

                <p>My current goal is to continue reviewing my basics. Furthermore, I hope to upload as much content
                    as I can onto GitHub so I can reflect on my growth over time. I want to continue with Codedex and attend
                    the events that are hosted for Club Members. I also want to join Hackathons to continue networking
                    and experience events that will help push me further in my coding journey. I am optimistic about the 
                    future and wish to continue working hard down this path.

                <p>After realizing I had to take the time to brush up on my fundamentals, I came across the Codedex website.
                    I was immediately drawn by the similarities to a video game. Having played games for the majority of
                    my life, I was very receptive to the design. I found their guides very helpful and especially intuitive.
                    I began learning Python as well as Web Development. I have also viewed the projects listed to further
                    my understanding of the topics. I genuinely find a lot of promise in the website and also enjoy the 
                    oppotunities available in the community. I believe I finally found a guide that suits my style of
                    learning.

                <p>In July of 2024, I was accepted into the Headstarter AI Fellowship. During my time, I was supposed to 
                    work on 5 projects to strengthen in my skills and grow my network. Sadly, I did not prepare
                    accordingly. I had multiple roadblocks with availability and time management. As a result, I was 
                    unable to complete every assignment. Having reflected on my mistake, I am now working actively to 
                    take my job hunt seriously.</p>
